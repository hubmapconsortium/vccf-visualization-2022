#### **Explore Skin Tissue Data in 3D**

All tissue datasets used in this study can be explored in their three-dimensional size, position, and rotation in the context of the Human Reference Atlas. In total, 12 data sets were collected and 10 were used in the final analysis (2 were excluded due to presence of a benign cyst (region 6) and scarring (region 12). For the final 10 datasets that were analyzed, **six** were collected from male donors, and **four** were collected from female donors. Using the [Exploration User Interface](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/ccf-eui) (EUI), you can:

- **Select an organ**: one can navigate available organs by selecting them from the carousel above the stage or using the ontology on the left. Select ‘Skin’ to see all skin datasets on stage.
- **Filter**: above the Search is the Filter icon which opens a menu with many options (e.g., sex, assay types, etc.) for refining what tissue data is presented. Under Tissue Providers, select ‘RTI-General Electric’ to see 312 tissue sections from 12 donors listed on right. Click on one of the 12 tissue blocks listed to see all tissue sections cut from it.
- **Registered Blocks**: it is possible to select a block of tissue samples either using the bodies on stage or the cards in the right column. Color coding helps to identify different selections. Select tissue block on the male head to see age, BMI and to explore the 28 tissue sections cut from it.
- **Data** : using the cards in the right column, click on items to dig deeper into the data. **You can watch a tutorial on how to use the EUI** [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAHJqvD3Q_8).

**Skin Anatomical Structures, Cell Types and Biomarker (ASCT+B) Table and Comparison**

In support of CCF design, ASCT+B table was compiled for all organs under investigation in HuBMAP, see details for ASCT+B table effort [here](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html). A subset of these anatomical structures (AS), cell types (CT) and biomarkers (B) were included in this paper. The[ASCT+B Reporter](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter) was used to comparethe AS, CT and B  used in this  paper to the most recent version (1.2) of the skin ASCT+B aster table.

**Vascular Common Coordinate Framework Visualization - Immune Cell Cluster Density**

These interactive plots show the 3D view of the distribution and clustering of immune cells (T cells). The immune cell cluster view allows for the identification of areas with high immune cell density through the use of heatmap-like bubbles of varying sizes and colors. Large, yellow bubbles indicate a high density of immune cells, while small, dark blue bubbles indicate a lower density.

**Statistical comparison between 2D and 3D immune cell counts**

(A) Average number of all T cells within 30 µm of a T helper cell in 2D (red) and 3D (blue) for each region. Overall, the number of immune cells within 30 µm of a T helper cell was higher in 3D compared to 2D with 10-70% more cells found in 3D; (B) Maximum number of immune cells within 30 μm of a T helper cell. There was variation across all regions, for example, in region 7 there was a cluster of 11 immune cells within 30 μm in 3D while just 3 cells were quantified in 2D.

Histogram of distance of immune cells (CD68, T helper, T killer, and T reg) to nearest endothelial cell. 3D distance tends to be much shorter (distance was capped at 1000 µm for visualization). The average distance of the nearest endothelial cell to immune cells in 3D was approximately half that found in 2D (~56 µm vs 108 µm on average). Two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to confirm that there is statistically significant difference between the 2D and 3D distributions for total immune cell counts (D =0.43, p-value <2.2e-16).

#### **Skin 3D Models**

The CCF 3D Reference Object Library provides anatomically correct reference organs. The organs are developed by a specialist in 3D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.

Initially, reference objects are created using data from the Visible Human male and female datasets provided by the National Library of Medicine. The male dataset comprises 1,871 cross-sections at 1mm intervals for both CT and anatomical images at a resolution of 4,096 pixels by 2,700 pixels. The female data set has the same characteristics as the Visible Human Male but axial anatomical images were obtained at 0.33 mm intervals resulting in 5,189 cross-section anatomical images. The male was white, 180.3 cm (71 inch) tall, 199-pound and was 38 years old. The female was white, 171.2 cm (67.4 inch) tall, obese, and 59 years old.

On March 12, 2022, a total of 50 reference organs--including the human skin--became available in GLB format. Each organ can be viewed and explored using free web browsers such as [Babylon.js.](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/)

You can explore all the 3D models of the HRA at [https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library)

**Future work: Immune cells 3D mesh view**

These interactive plots show the 3D representation of a set of triangles with vertices that outline the immune cells. This part is our future work and not included in the paper. These visualizations allow for the observation of the spatial distribution of immune cells within a skin sample through the use of 3D meshes and polygons. These distributions highlight the differences in both the spatial arrangements and overlap of various types of immune cells. The 3D meshes and polygons are created based on the spatial coordinates of the immune cells, and the shape of the mesh can also be influenced by the parameter alphahull.
